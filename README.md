# What princess are you?

I worked on the CSS animation part. However, I added some of the Javascript part as well.

## What Worked Well
Using HTML, CSS to style the page worked well. Programming clicks and results worked well too.

## What Didn't
Trying to get the JSON file to translate images didn't work as well. In addition, formatting was sometimes difficult.
